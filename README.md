# Coffee-Shop-Sales-Report

In this Excel project, I developed an in-depth sales analysis for a coffee shop, utilizing Excel for data management, visualization, and insights. Key elements included:

1. Data Cleaning and Data Processing : Organized sales data to capture product types, sales volume, and peak hours.

2. Trend Analysis : Highlighted customer preferences, peak sales times, and seasonal trends.

3. Data Visualization : Created charts to make data interpretation easier, including bar graphs for product comparisons and line graphs for sales trends over time.

4. Insights : Delivered actionable insights to optimize stock levels, align with customer demands, and identify growth opportunities.
